# Ethernaut Challenges

This repository contains my solutions to the [Ethernaut](https://ethernaut.openzeppelin.com/) challenges. Ethernaut is a Web3/Solidity-based wargame played in the Ethereum Virtual Machine. Each level is a smart contract that has some vulnerability. The goal is to "hack" the smart contract and take ownership of it.

## Challenges

The Solidity files in this repository correspond to the different Ethernaut challenges. Each file contains the code for the respective challenge.

## Usage

These files can be used to study and understand the vulnerabilities in the Ethernaut challenges. You can use a local development environment like Hardhat or Foundry to deploy and interact with these contracts.
